**Café Sales Data Cleaning & Preparation**

**Project Overview**
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
This project involved cleaning and preparing a transactional dataset from a café for further exploratory data analysis (EDA). The dataset originally contained missing values, inconsistent records, and ambiguous item-price relationships. The objective was to build a reliable and structured dataset suitable for generating insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and operational efficiency.

**Data Issues Identified**
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
    **Missing Values**: Null entries in Item, Price, Quantity, and Payment Method.
    
    **Inconsistent Records**: Total Spent column did not match Quantity × Price in several cases.
    
    ****Ambiguity in Item-Price Mapping****: Items such as Salad and Smoothie shared the same unit price, making item inference difficult when names were missing.
    
    ****Null Categorical Fields****: Payment Method and Location had gaps that required treatment.

**Cleaning Process**
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
    **Missing Item & Price Handling** – Cross-checked Item-Price mapping. Where possible, filled missing Item using Price, and vice versa. For ambiguous cases, left as "Unknown".
    
    **Quantity Imputation** – Replaced missing quantities with item-level averages or modes, ensuring realistic sales values.
    
    **Recalculated Total Spent** – Overwrote inconsistent totals by applying the formula Quantity × Price.
    
    **Categorical Data Treatment**– Filled missing Payment Method and Location with "Unknown" to maintain completeness without biasing results.
    
    **Row Validation**– Removed invalid records where both Quantity and Price were missing.
    
    **Item Popularity Check** – Compared item sales across Price, Location, and Payment Method. Since values were very close across combinations, popularity could not be used reliably for imputations.

    **Null Tracking in SQL** – Used SQL queries to measure null counts before and after cleaning to validate improvements.
